Setter injections create setter methods in the class for injections. Configuration of the dependency injection will use the @Autowired Annotation.
Injection Types (Which one to use?)
1. Construction Injection: Used when you have required/specified dependencies(Generally recommended by the spring.io development team as first choice)
2. Setter Injection: Used when you have optional dependencies (If no dependency provided, the app provides reasonable default logic)

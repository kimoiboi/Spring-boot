Development Process:
1. Create a java class and use the @Configuration annotation
2. Define @Bean method to configure the bean
3. Inject the bean into our controller
Use Case for @Bean:
1. Make an existing third-party class available to the Spring Framework
2. You may not have access to the source code of the third-party class so you will make use of the third-party class as a Spring Bean
Real-World Project Example:
The AWS S3 client code is part of the AWS SDK(we can't modify the AWS SDK source code, so we can't simply add the @Component annotation to use as a bean), however we can 
configure it as a Spring Bean by using @Bean allowing us to use the Amazon S3 Client in our Spring Application which can inject it into other services of our application.

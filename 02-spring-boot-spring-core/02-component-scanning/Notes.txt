Component Scanning scans everything in com.luv2code.springcoredemo + any sub-packages (recursively). It will start scanning where the main Spring Boot application class is.
What about any other packages like com.luv2code.util? You must explicitly list base packages to scan (as seen in SpringcoredemoApplication.java)

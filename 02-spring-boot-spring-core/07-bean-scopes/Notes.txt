Bean Scopes, A scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean(How long does the bean live?, How many instances are created?, How is the bean shared?).
The default scope is a "Singleton". A singleton refers to the spring container where it creates only one instance of the bean, by default.
Singletons are cached in the memory and all dependency injections done for the bean will reference the SAME bean.
Additional Spring Bean Scopes:
1. Singleton - Creates a single shared instance of the bean. Default Scope.
2. Prototype - Creates a new bean instance for each container request.
3. Request - Scoped to an HTTP web request. Used only for web apps.
4. Session - Scoped to an HTTP web session. Used only for web apps.
5. Application - Scoped to a web app ServletContext. Used only for web apps.
6. Websocket - Scoped to a web socket. Used only for web apps.
Must use the @Scope Annotation to specify which scope to use when creating instances of beans.

Lazy initialization is used when you dont want to create all beans up front. A bean will only be initialized in the following cases:
1. It is needed for dependency injection
2. or it is explicitly requested
Adding the @Lazy Annotation to a given class will apply these rules.
To apply the Lazy initialization globally across all classes you must go into the application.properties file: spring.main.lazy-initialization=true (No beans created until they're explicitly needed)
Advantages: Creates objects as needed, May help with faster startup time if you have large number of components
Disadvantages: Web related components like @RestController will not be created until requested, Configuration issues may not be found until its too late, Must have enough memory for creation of beans

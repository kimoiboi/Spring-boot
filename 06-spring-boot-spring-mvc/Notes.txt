Spring MVC - Thymeleaf with Spring Boot
What is Thymeleaf? (URL: www.thymeleaf.org)
- Thymeleaf is a Java templating engine that is commonly used to generate the HTML views for web apps
- However it is a general purpose templating engine so it can use Thymeleaf outside of web apps (More on this later) 
- You can create Java apps with Thymeleaf (No need for Spring, but there is a lot of Synergy between Thymeleaf & Spring Boot)

What is a Thymeleaf template?
- Can be an HTML page with some Thymeleaf expressions & can include dynamic content from Thymeleaf expressions
- This allows it to access Java code, Objects, Spring Beans

Where is the Thymeleaf template processed?
- In a web app, Thymeleaf is processed on the server
- Results included in HTML returned to browser
Architecture Process:
		1			    2(Model)			    3
Web Browser --------> Spring MVC Controller --------> Thymeleaf template --------> Web Browser

Thymeleaf with Spring Boot - Development Process
1. Add Thymeleaf to the Maven POM file
2. Develop Spring MVC Controller
3. Create the Thymeleaf template

Where to place Thymeleaf template?
- In Spring Boot, your Thymeleaf template files go in: src/main/resources/templates
- For Web Apps, Thymeleaf templates have a .html extension

Additional Features of Thymeleaf
- Looping and Conditionals
- CSS & JavaScript Integration
- Template Layouts and Fragments

Working With CSS & Thymeleaf
To use CSS with Thymeleaf Templates, you have the option of using:
-  Local CSS files as part of your project (We will cover this)
- Referencing remote CSS files (We will cover this)

Working With CSS & Thymeleaf - Development Process 
1. Create CSS file
2. Reference the CSS file in the Thymeleaf Template 
3. Apply CSS Style 

Spring Boot will usually look for static resources in the directory: src/main/resources/static (We will create another sub-directory for CSS that stores our CSS in there)
